      <h2 class="text-h2 text-primary mb-6">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-body mb-5">
        ArcticFlow HVAC was founded with a simple mission: to provide Las Vegas residents and businesses with honest, reliable, and expert HVAC services. With years of experience serving the Las Vegas Valley, our team of certified technicians has built a reputation for quality workmanship, fair pricing, and outstanding customer service.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-body mb-5">
        We understand that in the Nevada desert, your HVAC system is not just about comfort — it is about safety. When temperatures exceed 110°F in summer or drop below freezing on winter nights, you need a heating and cooling company that responds quickly and gets the job done right the first time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-body mb-5">
        As a locally owned and operated business, we take pride in being part of the Las Vegas community. Every customer is our neighbor, and we treat every home and business with the care and respect they deserve. Our technicians are not just skilled professionals — they are members of this community who understand the unique challenges of maintaining comfort in the desert.
